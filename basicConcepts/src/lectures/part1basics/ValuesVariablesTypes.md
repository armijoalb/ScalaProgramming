# Values Variables and Types in Scala
## Values
values are define with the *val* reserve word, they are immutable. Are similar to constants, but not equal.
````scala
val x:Int = 42
````

for *val* is not necessary to use types, the compiler can infer that type.
*;* is not necessary in scala, but if you put more than one statement in a line it is, but that's not recommended in 
scala, it's bad practices.
